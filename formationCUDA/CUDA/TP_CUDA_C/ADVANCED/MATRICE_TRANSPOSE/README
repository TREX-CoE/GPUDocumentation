1) complete copy2d.cu

2) copy copy2d.cu into transpose_global.cu
   modify transpose_global.cu to perform a matrice transposition

3) complete transpose_block.cu to perform a matrice transposition by block

4) in transpose_block.cu, use shared memory as indermediate buffer for the transposition by block

5) complete transpose_shared.cu to perform a full transposition using shared memory

6) complete bank.cu

7) optimize bank.cu

8) optimize transpose_shared.cu

cudaError_t cudaMalloc( void ** devPtr, size_t  size )

  Parameters:
  devPtr        - Pointer to allocated device memory
  size          - Requested allocation size in bytes



cudaError_t cudaMemcpy( void *dst, const void *src, size_t count, enum cudaMemcpyKind kind )

  Parameters:
  dst   - Destination memory address
  src   - Source memory address
  count - Size in bytes to copy
  kind  - Type of transfer: cudaMemcpyHostToHost, cudaMemcpyHostToDevice, cudaMemcpyDeviceToHost, or cudaMemcpyDeviceToDevice



cudaError_t cudaFree( void *devPtr )

  Parameters:
  devPtr        - Device pointer to memory to free



__global__   declares kernel, which is called on host and executed on device
__device__   declares device function, which is called and executed on device
__host__     declares host function, which is called and executed on host


dim3 : integer vector type
  dim3 value( nx, ny, nz );

kernelName<<< blocksInGrid, threadsPerBlock >>>(args, ... );


Pre-defined variables
 gridDim        dimensions of grid
 blockDim       dimensions of block
 blockIdx       block index within grid
 threadIdx      thread index within block



Declaring variables
__device__  	declares device variable in global memory, accessible from all threads, with lifetime of application
__constant__	declares device variable in constant memory, accessible from all threads, with lifetime of application
__shared__  	declares device varibale in block's shared memory, accessible from all threads within a block, with lifetime of block
