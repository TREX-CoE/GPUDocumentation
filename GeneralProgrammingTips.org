** Variables declaration
    When you use OpenMp and/or openAcc you can't declare array or pointers inside parallel section, even if it's inside a function call. When you program the best option is to think like you code in Fortran.
    Declare all your varaibles and array at the start of the function, and after move it where you need it. After you can do your compute.
